# Permalink As A Service

This is an implementation of the permalink-as-a-service idea described in my [blog post](http://tobyho.com/2015/05/28/permalink-as-a-service/). It is written in io.js with the help of the Koa framework.

## Running

Install io.js, recommended via nvm.

```
nvm install iojs-v2.0.0
```

Clone this repo, cd into the project directory, then:

```
nvm use
npm install
```
Run the server:

```
node server.js
```
